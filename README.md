Scrap all available data from both typeracerdata.com and also data.typeracer.com for profiles of your choosing.

This doesn't work currently 2022, it did in 2020 trust me, but they changed the webpage and the HTML is probably different.
I tried to fix it by commenting stuff out, but too much stuff is null, leading me to believe they changed that part of the webpage.
Typeracer has overwent some very serious redesigns since creating the project, and I haven't updated the project since 2020.
This is now a relic. Though a pretty relic. Also I fogot to upload the libraries needed for this lol.
